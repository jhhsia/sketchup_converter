// which by default will include winsock.h.  That conflicts with
// google3/base/port.h which explicitly includes winsock2.h.  This macro
// prevents the inclusion and conflicts.  A better solution may be to just take
// control of our own types (i.e. SU_BOOL, etc) and abandon the tangled windows
// include files entirely.  That would also eliminate the need for such
// nonsense as CBOOL to avoid objc conflicts.
// TODO(julmer): Move this macro to a config file.
